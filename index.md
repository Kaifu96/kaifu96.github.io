## Quote

> Fishing-stakes are employed to catch fish; but when the fish are got, the stakes are forgotten. Snares are employed to catch hares, but when the hares are got, the snares are forgotten. Words are employed to convey ideas; but when the ideas are apprehended, the words are forgotten. Fain would I talk with such a man who has forgot the words! (Chuang Tzu)
